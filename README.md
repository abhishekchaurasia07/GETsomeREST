Hi! We're glad to know you are coming for our API development workshop. Here are a **list of prerequisite software and packages** that you must have before the workshop starts. We've also included instructions to download and install them where applicable. 


## Visual Studio Code  
Visual Studio Code is a free source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. You can download the latest version [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download). 

## Postman

[Postman]([https://www.postman.com/downloads/])'s features simplify testing and building an API and streamline collaboration so you can create better APIsâ€”faster.
> You can watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s26Yhtd4TB4) for steps to install Postman on Windows 10

## Node.js

Download  [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 12 **LTS** edition. LTS versions provide long term support and deemed to be more stable and bug-free than the latest editions. 
>We **highly recommend** that you watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JINE4D0Syqw) (Windows 10) so that your installation is properly done and there are no issues during the Workshop.

## Azure

Make an account on [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) and claim the free 200USD credit and 12 months of free service. We need this to deploy our API.
